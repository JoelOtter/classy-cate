# Classy CATE

CATE, without the hurt.

## Development

To develop and help improve classy-cate, do the following:

1. run the python HTTPS server with `python serve.py`
2. Modify `classy-cate.user.js` js/css references to refer to the local python server e.g. `https://raw.github.com/PeterHamilton/classy-cate/master/ -> https://localhost:8443/classy-cate.css`
3. Install your modified `classy-cate.user.js` as an Userscript/Greasemonkey extension in Chrome/Firefox. In chrome, you will need to open `settings -> extensions` and drag the file into chrome as it blocks third party installs.
4. And you're done! Improve Classy-CATE, Refresh, Repeat.
